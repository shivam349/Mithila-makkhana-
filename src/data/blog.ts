Their low glycemic index makes them ideal for diabetic-friendly diets, while the amino acid profile helps in muscle recovery. When roasted without excess oil, makhana becomes a light, crunchy snack that supports satiety without spiking blood sugar levels. Ayurveda also recommends makhana for its cooling properties, making it suitable during fasts and festive seasons.",

Our sourcing partners follow traditional techniques that preserve nutrients while ensuring the crunch you love. Supporting these farmers means sustaining an age-old craft and providing rural livelihoods across the Mithila region.",
